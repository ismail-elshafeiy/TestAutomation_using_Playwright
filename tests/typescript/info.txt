TypeScript Is A Strongly Typed Programming Language That Builds On JavaScript
TypeScript Developed And Maintained By Microsoft
TypeScript Is JavaScript With Types
Typescript Add Features To JavaScript Without Changing It

## WHY WE NEED TYPESCRIPT ?
    * Detect Errors Without Running The Code "Static Type Checking ==
    * Analyze The Code As You Type
    * Will Help You When You Write React, Vue, Angular Apps
    * Gives You The Missing Features In JS Like "Interfaces, Generics, Decorators”

## HOW TYPESCRIPT WORKS ?
    * TypeScript Compiler Compile TS Code Into JavaScript Code "This Called Transpilation“”
    * How About The New Features? Workaround

## What to need to know as pre-requests
    JavaScript consept, variables , Arrays , Objects , Functions , conditions

## Steps to Install TypeScript 
    * Install Nodejs
    * Be Nodejs Its Installed Check From Terminal `node -v` 
    * Install Typescript. `npm i -g typescript`
    * Be Typescript Its Installed Check From Terminal `tsc -v`
    * Create TS File
    * Compile JS File
    * Check TS Playground

## Statically vs Dynamically Typed Languages
    - Statically Typed Language Like [Rust, C, C++]
        * Variables Types Are Static, Once You Declare It You Cannot Change
        * Type Of A Variable Is Known At Compile Time "Do Type Checking At Compile-Time"
        * Have Better Performance At Run-Time Due To Not Needing To Check Types Dynamically
        * Error Detected earlier

    Dynamically Typed Language Like [PHP, Python, JavaScript]
        * Variables Types Are Dynamic, You Can Always Change It
        * Type Checking At Execution-Time”
        * Error Can Be Detected After Execution

- init tsconfig.json file `tsc --init`
